I would like to start off by stating how useful this sessions are.

From the beginning Rafa reach out to us with this initiative in where all the new
team members are going to be able to have a 'safe-space' where questions and doubts are going
to be resolved.
We had 5 sessions with different topics; some proposed by Rafa and some others proposed by
us. They were about an hour long and everybody had a chance to share their insights.
In addition, this 'safe-space' allowed us to share our experiences and
bumps that we have had along the way and share how we solved those issues and provide
tips and tricks on how to tackle them.


Rafa.
I could not be more grateful with Rafa's leadership and guidance through out my on-boarding
process; he is constantly open to help me and the others with complex and even silly
questions. I strongly believe Rafa's is the right person for this. I wish we
had this sessions when I first joined the company back in late 2018.
