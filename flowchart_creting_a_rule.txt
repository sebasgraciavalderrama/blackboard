1. Instantiate a new rule
    context -> view.php?controller=editrule&courseid=XXX&action=add&ruleid=0
    In the protected function init(){
        If the rule exist's get the rule through the id
            rule = local_pld_get_rule(ruleid)
        else create a new one with ruleid=0
            rule = new local_pld_rule(0) //it's 0 'cause we are creating a dummy for the moment
    }
2. In public function save_action(){
    All the rule data such as: rule name, disabled, condition evaluation mode, userid, courseid, events, conditions and actions

        If the rule exist's then update it
            $DB->update_record(...)
        else add it with new event, condition, actions
            $DB->insert_record(local_pld_rule_trigger, $event)
            $DB->insert_record(local_pld_condition, $condition)
            $DB->insert_record(local_pld_condition, $action)
            $DB->insert_record(local_pld_rule_action, array(ruleid, actionid, sequence))
    }
