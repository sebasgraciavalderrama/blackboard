Late work
It was October the 31st A cold and long night.

Every now and then HR throws a Halloween costume party, so there were noises and people chatting but I was
caught up with work.

Suddenly, I see people dressed up as monsters and movie characters, running by, almost drunk. Such a fuss!

Now there is music! The office is loud and I am one of the last on their work station because I needed
to wrap up with some late work.

But I've just remembered that I had been dead for a while. It is a bummer that I only arise on October 31,
 while all this people celebrate and make noise, because I still have work to do.
